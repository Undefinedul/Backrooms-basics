		<p>The primary way of entering and traversing the backrooms is by a method called "nocliping". Nocliping is a term originating in videogame programing and is the action of bypassing the games system used for enshuring the player charicter can interact with the inviroment.  in other words nocliping is a way to pass through physical objects and boounderys. in the backrooms cannon, noclipping is described by Fandoms, "A Brief Guide to Noclipping" as "Noclipping (or no-clipping) is the everyman's way of traversing the Backrooms, simple and easy; all it takes is a leap of faith, metaphorically and literally. Rather than attempting to find a natural level exit ...  you can simply throw yourself into a wall and hope for the best." noclipping is the action of running at an unstable surface (charicterised by being in an abandoned area and unusualy darker than the suroundings) and hopeing that you did it right.</p>

	<tr> 
		<td> <p>But as stated before. there are multiple ways to fail a noclip, other than just hitting youre head on a wall, if you have enough energy to faze througe the object but not through another surface, you can fall into <b>The Void</b>, The void is a place inbetween the levels of the backrooms, a place of pure emptyness where you just fall and fall, it is theorised to be a sort of loading screen for when making a move as sudden and unexpected as noclipping. usualy the time spent in this place s minnimal, usualy millliseconds but some people report haing spent up to a 30 seconds, whitch isint mutch but when we are talking about falling in a dark void can feel like an eternity, but sometimes some unlucky folk can get stuck here falling forever.<p>

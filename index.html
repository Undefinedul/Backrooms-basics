		<td><p> As stated before, there are many interpritations of the backrooms usualy logs of the backrooms by a higher organisation. Logs are divided into three groups, Levels, Entities, and Objects. Levels, a term taken from dungen crawler esq videogames, are the disticnct parts that make up the backrooms, most of them have entrances and exits, which are usualy chalenges that you eed to compleate to move on. levels also vary in survivablility, with some levels being entiraly habitible and some are quite the opposite. next up are the Entities, which is comprised of mosty dangerus creatures. Most Entities are supernatural in nature, like the smile, a disimbodied lumenesent smile, that likes to linger in dark areas. and then there are the Objects, which are just supernatural or uniqe items that only apear in the backrooms, sutch as almond water and the isusive neon water.</p> </td>

		 <p>The majority of the levels vary from the different interpritations of the backrooms. But the one level that usualy syats the ame is the first, born from a spooky pickture of the back-rooms of a sears and a 4chan thread, Level 0. the first thing you will notice appoun entering level 0, is the desaturated- monocromatic yellow walls, the moldy crpet and the anoying buzz of office lights. The next thing you will notice is the lack of life, bringing a sense of eary ... <a href="liminal.html"> Liminality </a> to the place. the majority of wanderers land here when first entering the backrooms, this is the begginning of there jorney, but sadly it is usualy the end, as level 0 hase no specific, safe, or stable exits, in  the wikidot page for level 0 it is sayed that the exit to level 1 requires wanderers to <a href="entering.html">"noclip"</a> and the fandom page for level 0 states that entrance to level 1 us purely random.</p>

		<p>But nowadays there is a new interpritation of the Backrooms. sparked by the amazing 3d moddeling and animation done by Kane Pixles, the backrooms was pushed back out of the depths of the internet and into the mainstream, and as of late has been keaped in the back of the minds of every one ever scence. you see, if you ever hear about "A-SYNC" or if you ever see pictures of people in big bagy yellow hazmat suits with a large black visor obscuring there face, its becuse of cain pixles. a small desclemer if tyou do go and watch there videos, some of the viedeos have more mature themes.</p>

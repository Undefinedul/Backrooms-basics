		<p>Liminaltiy is a strange consept that is usualy tied to realigon, acourding to wikipedia, it is the "quality of ambiguity, or disorientation that occurs in the middle stage of a rite of passage". in layman's terms it is the state of discomfurt, doubt or uncertaness of the midpoint of a change. and merriam webster defines "Liminal" as "of, relating to, or being an intermediate state, phase, or condition". This ties back with the backrooms withn the internet phenomina of "Liminal Spaces", described by wikipedia as having "the intent to convey 'a sense of nostalgia, lostness, and uncertainty' ".</p>

		<p> Liminal spaces are ment to be creepy, like if you arent supposed to be there. imagen a mall with all the lights on, stores open, and the noises of busy people going about their day. but now imagen that there are no people, imagen that the stores preaveusly buisy with loads of cousumers now lay dormint. that is the feeling that the backrooms is trying to show us. and it cant do this without the essence of liminality.</p>
		</p> the image on the right is of an example give in the wikipedia article. and the image on the left was taken by youres truly, right out side of the v wing,. i took the pickture to show that any place can show a staark fealing of lonelyness if done correctly.
